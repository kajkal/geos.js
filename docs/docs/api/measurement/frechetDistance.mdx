# frechetDistance

Compute the discrete Fréchet distance between geometry `a` and geometry `b`.
The [Fréchet distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_distance)
is a measure of similarity: it is the greatest distance between any point in
`a` and the closest point in `b`.

The discrete distance is an approximation of this metric: only vertices are
considered. The parameter `options.densify` makes this approximation less coarse
by splitting the line segments between vertices before computing the distance.

Fréchet distance sweep continuously along their respective curves and the
direction of curves is significant. This makes it a better measure of similarity
than Hausdorff distance for curve or surface matching.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| `a` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) | First geometry |
| `b` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) | Second geometry |
| `options?` | **`object`** | Optional options object |
| `options.densify?` | **`number`** | Optional fraction by which densify each line segment. <br/> Each segment will be split into a number of equal-length subsegments, whose fraction of the total length is closest to the given fraction. Value of `0.25` means that each segment will be split into four equal length subsegments. <br/> The closer to `0` the better the approximation of the distance. |

## Returns

**`number`** Approximation of Fréchet distance between geometries

## Throws

- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) on unsupported geometry types (curved)
- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) when either geometry is empty
- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) when `options.densify` is not in the range `(0.0, 1.0]`

## Examples

```js live noInline
const a = lineString([ [ 0, 0 ], [ 100, 0 ] ]);
const b = lineString([ [ 0, 0 ], [ 50, 50 ], [ 100, 0 ] ]);
const ab_fDist = frechetDistance(a, b); // 70.71067811865476
const ab_fDist_d = frechetDistance(a, b, { densify: 0.5 }); // 50

// this example is alive!
render(preview({ a, b, ab_fDist, ab_fDist_d }));
```

```js live noInline
// with a comparison to Hausdorff distance
const a = lineString([ [ 0, 0 ], [ 50, 200 ], [ 100, 0 ], [ 150, 200 ], [ 200, 0 ] ]);
const b1 = lineString([ [ 0, 200 ], [ 200, 150 ], [ 0, 100 ], [ 200, 50 ], [ 0, 0 ] ]);
const b2 = lineString([ [ 0, 0 ], [ 200, 50 ], [ 0, 100 ], [ 200, 150 ], [ 0, 200 ] ]);
const ab1_hDist = hausdorffDistance(a, b1); // 48.507125007266595
const ab2_hDist = hausdorffDistance(a, b2); // 48.507125007266595
const ab1_fDist = frechetDistance(a, b1); // 200
const ab2_fDist = frechetDistance(a, b2); // 282.842712474619

// this example is alive!
render(preview({ a, b1, b2, ab1_hDist, ab2_hDist, ab1_fDist, ab2_fDist }));
```
