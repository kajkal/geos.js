# distance

Computes the Cartesian distance between geometry `a` and geometry `b`.

Distance is in input geometry units.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| `a` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) | First geometry |
| `b` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) | Second geometry |

## Returns

**`number`** The distance between the geometries

## Throws

- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) on unsupported geometry types (curved)
- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) when either geometry is empty

## See also

- [`nearestPoints`](nearestPoints.mdx) to find nearest points of two geometries

## Examples

```js live title="distance between point and line"
const a = point([ 0, 0 ]);
const b = lineString([ [ 0, 1 ], [ 1, 0 ] ]);
const ab_dist = distance(a, b); // 0.7071067811865476 = Math.sqrt(2) / 2
```

```js live title="distance between line and polygon"
const a = lineString([ [ -1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ] ]);
const b = polygon([ [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 1, 2 ], [ 2, 1 ], [ 1, 1 ] ] ]);
const ab_dist = distance(a, b); // 1.4142135623730951 = Math.sqrt(2)
```

```js live title="distance between two polygons"
const a = polygon([ [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 1 ], [ 0, 1 ], [ 0, 0 ] ] ]);
const b = polygon([ [ [ 2, 2 ], [ 3, 2 ], [ 3, 3 ], [ 2, 2 ] ] ]);
const ab_dist = distance(a, b); // 1.4142135623730951 = Math.sqrt(2)
```
