# nearestPoints

Finds the nearest points between geometry `a` and geometry `b`.

The returned points can be points along a line segment, not necessarily
one of the vertices of the input geometries.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| `a` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) | First geometry |
| `b` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) | Second geometry |

## Returns

**`[`** [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx), [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) **`]`** An array with two geometries, first is the nearest point from the
geometry `a` second from the geometry `b`

## Throws

- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) on unsupported geometry types (curved)
- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) when either geometry is empty

## See also

- [`distance`](distance.mdx) to calculate the distance between two geometries

## Examples

```js live title="nearest points between point and line"
const a = point([ 0, 0 ]);
const b = lineString([ [ 0, 1 ], [ 1, 0 ] ]);
const [ a_pt, b_pt ] = nearestPoints(a, b); // [ <POINT (0 0)>, <POINT (0.5 0.5)> ]
```

```js live title="nearest points between two polygons"
const a = polygon([ [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 0, 2 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ] ] ]);
const b = polygon([ [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ], [ 2, 2 ], [ 1, 2 ], [ 1, 1 ] ] ]);
const [ a_pt, b_pt ] = nearestPoints(a, b); // [ <POINT (0.6 0.8)>, <POINT (1 1)> ]
```
