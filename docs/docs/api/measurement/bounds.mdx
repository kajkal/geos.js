Calculates the bounds (also named bbox - bounding box or extent) of the geometry.
The bounds are the minimum rectangle that contains the entire geometry.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| `geometry` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) | The geometry for which the bounds are calculated |

## Returns

**`[ xMin: number, yMin: number, xMax: number, yMax: number ]`** An array of four numbers `[ xMin, yMin, xMax, yMax ]`

## Throws

- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) when called on an empty geometry

## Examples

```ts
const poly = polygon([ [ [ 3, 3 ], [ 9, 4 ], [ 5, 1 ], [ 3, 3 ] ] ]);
bounds(poly); // [ 3, 1, 9, 4 ]
```
