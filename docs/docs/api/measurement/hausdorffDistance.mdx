# hausdorffDistance

Computes the discrete Hausdorff distance between geometry `a` and geometry `b`.
The [Hausdorff distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance)
is a measure of similarity: it is the greatest distance between any point in
`a` and the closest point in `b`.

The discrete distance is an approximation of this metric: only vertices are
considered. The parameter `options.densify` makes this approximation less coarse
by splitting the line segments between vertices before computing the distance.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| `a` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) | First geometry |
| `b` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) | Second geometry |
| `options?` | **`object`** | Optional options object |
| `options.densify?` | **`number`** | Optional fraction by which densify each line segment. <br/> Each segment will be split into a number of equal-length subsegments, whose fraction of the total length is closest to the given fraction. Value of `0.25` means that each segment will be split into four equal length subsegments. <br/> The closer to `0` the better the approximation of the distance. |

## Returns

**`number`** Approximation of Hausdorff distance between geometries

## Throws

- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) on unsupported geometry types (curved)
- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) when either geometry is empty
- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) when `options.densify` is not in the range `(0.0, 1.0]`

## Examples

```js live
const a = lineString([ [ 0, 0 ], [ 100, 0 ], [ 10, 100 ], [ 10, 100 ] ]);
const b = lineString([ [ 0, 100 ], [ 0, 10 ], [ 80, 10 ] ]);
const ab_hDist = hausdorffDistance(a, b); // 22.360679774997898 - approximation is not close
const ab_hDist_d = hausdorffDistance(a, b, { densify: 0.001 }); // 47.89
```
