# buffer

Creates a buffer around a geometry with a specified distance.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | :-: | :-: | --- |
| `geometry` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) |  | The geometry to buffer |
| `distance` | **`number`** |  | The buffer distance. Positive values expand the geometry, negative values shrink it |
| `options?` | **`object`** |  | Optional parameters to control buffer generation |
| `options.quadrantSegments?` | **`number`** | `8` | The default number of facets into which to divide a fillet of 90 degrees. <br/> A value of 8 gives less than 2% max error in the buffer distance. For a max error of < 1%, use QS = 12. For a max error of < 0.1%, use QS = 18. The error is always less than the buffer distance. |
| `options.endCapStyle?` | **`'round'`** \| **`'flat'`** \| **`'square'`** | `'round'` | Cap styles control the ends of buffered lines. <ul><li>`round` - End is rounded, with end point of original line in the center of the round cap. </li><li>`flat` - End is flat, with end point of original line at the end of the buffer. </li><li>`square` - End is flat, with end point of original line in the middle of a square enclosing that point. </li></ul> |
| `options.joinStyle?` | **`'round'`** \| **`'mitre'`** \| **`'bevel'`** | `'round'` | Join styles control the buffer shape at bends in a line. <ul><li>`round` - Join is rounded, essentially each line is terminated in a round cap. Form round corner. </li><li>`mitre` - Join is flat, with line between buffer edges, through the join point. Forms flat corner. </li><li>`bevel` - Join is the point at which the two buffer edges intersect. Forms sharp corner. </li></ul> |
| `options.mitreLimit?` | **`number`** | `5.0` | For acute angles, a mitre join can extend very very far from the input geometry, which is probably not desired. The mitre limit places an upper bound on that. |
| `options.singleSided?` | **`boolean`** | `false` | Sets whether the computed buffer should be single-sided. A single-sided buffer is constructed on only one side of each input line. <br/> The side used is determined by the sign of the buffer distance: <ul><li>a positive distance indicates the left-hand side </li><li>a negative distance indicates the right-hand side </li></ul> The single-sided buffer of point geometries is the same as the regular buffer. <br/> The `endCapStyle` for single-sided buffers is always ignored and forced to the equivalent of `flat`. |

## Returns

[**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) A new, buffered, geometry

## Throws

- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) on invalid WKB data

## Examples

```ts title="create a simple buffer around a point"
const pt = point([ 0, 0 ]);
const circle = buffer(pt, 10);
```
```ts title="create a square-capped buffer around a line"
const line = lineString([ [ 0, 0 ], [ 10, 10 ] ]);
const path = buffer(line, 5, { endCapStyle: 'square' });
```
```ts title="create a buffer that shrinks the geometry"
const shrunken = buffer(geometry, -5);
// shrunk to nothing
toWKT(buffer(polygon([ [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 1, 0 ], [ 1, 1 ], [ 0, 0 ] ] ]), -5)); // 'POLYGON EMPTY'
// negative or zero-distance buffer of point or line - always empty
toWKT(buffer(lineString([ [ 0, 0 ], [ 10, 10 ] ]), 0)); // 'POLYGON EMPTY'
toWKT(buffer(point([ 0, 0 ]), 0)); // 'POLYGON EMPTY'
```
