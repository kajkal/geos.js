# Geometry.prototype.normalize

Organizes the elements, rings, and coordinate order of geometries in a
consistent way, so that geometries that represent the same object can
be easily compared.
Modifies the geometry in-place.

Normalization ensures the following:
- Lines are oriented to have smallest coordinate first (apart from duplicate endpoints)
- Rings start with their smallest coordinate (using XY ordering)
- Polygon **shell** rings are oriented **CW**, and **holes CCW**
- Collection elements are sorted by their first coordinate

Note the Polygon winding order, OGC standard uses the opposite convention
and so does GeoJSON. Polygon ring orientation could be changed via [orientPolygons](orientPolygons).

## Returns

[**`this`**](index.mdx) The same geometry but normalized, modified in-place
