# Geometry.prototype.free

Frees the Wasm memory allocated for the GEOS geometry object.

[`Geometry`](index.mdx) objects are automatically freed when they are out of scope.
This mechanism is provided by the [`FinalizationRegistry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/FinalizationRegistry)
that binds the lifetime of the Wasm resources to the lifetime of the JS objects.

This method exists as a backup for those who find `FinalizationRegistry`
unreliable and want a way to free the memory manually.

Use with caution, as when the object is manually freed, the underlying
Wasm resource becomes invalid and cannot be used anymore.

## Returns

**`void`**
