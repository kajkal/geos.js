# isValid

Returns `true` when the geometry is well-formed and valid in 2D according to
the OGC rules. For geometries with 3 and 4 dimensions, the validity is still
only tested in 2 dimensions.

Validity is defined for each Geometry type as follows:
- Point coordinates must be finite (not `NaN` or `Infinity`)
- MultiPoint points must all be valid
- LineString must have at least 2 unique points
- MultiLineString lines must all be valid
- LinearRing must have at lest 4 unique points, be closed (first and last
  point must be equal), be [simple](isSimple.mdx) i.e. must not self-intersect
  except at endpoints
- Polygon interior must be connected (some hole cannot split interior into parts)
  - Shell (exterior ring) must be a valid LinearRing, not be self-touching
    (could be configured by `options.isInvertedRingValid` parameter),
    not be exverted ("bow-tie" configuration)
  - Holes (interior rings) each must be a valid LinearRing, be completely
    inside the shell, not be nested inside other holes, not self-touch
    to create disconnected interiors, not be "C-shaped" with self-touching
    that creates islands
- MultiPolygon polygons must all be valid, no polygon can be in the interior
  of another polygon, shells cannot partially overlap or touch along an edge
- GeometryCollection geometries must all be valid
- Empty geometries are valid

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | :-: | :-: | --- |
| `geometry` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) |  | The geometry to check |
| `options?` | **`object`** |  | Optional options object |
| `options.isInvertedRingValid?` | **`boolean`** | `false` | Sets how to treat a polygon with self-touching rings. <br/> If set to `true` the following self-touching conditions are treated as being valid (ESRI SDE model): <ul><li>**inverted shell** - the shell ring self-touches to create a hole   touching the shell </li><li>**exverted hole** - a hole ring self-touches to create two holes   touching at a point </li></ul> If set to `false` the above conditions, following the OGC SFS standard, are treated as not valid. |

## Returns

**`boolean`** `true` when geometry is valid, `false` otherwise

## Throws

- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) on unsupported geometry types (curved)

## See also

- [`isValidOrThrow`](isValidOrThrow.mdx) throws an error when geometry is not valid
- [`makeValid`](../operations/makeValid.mdx) repairs invalid geometries

## Examples

```js live noInline
const line = lineString([ [ 1, 1 ], [ 2, 2 ] ]);
const line_valid = isValid(line); // true

const poly = polygon([ // self-touching exterior ring forming hole
    [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 0, 10 ], [ 10, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ], [ 4, 2 ], [ 2, 4 ], [ 0, 0 ] ],
]);
const poly_valid1 = isValid(poly); // false
const poly_valid2 = isValid(poly, { isInvertedRingValid: true }); // true

// this example is alive!
render(preview({ line, line_valid, poly, poly_valid1, poly_valid2 }));
```
