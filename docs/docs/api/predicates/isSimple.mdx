# isSimple

Returns `true` when the geometry is simple as defined by the OGC SFS
(Simple Feature Specification).
Simple means that any self-intersections are only at boundary points.
Mostly relevant for line strings.

Simplicity is defined for each Geometry type as follows:
- Point geometries are simple
- MultiPoint geometries are simple if every point is unique
- LineString geometries are simple if they do not self-intersect at interior
  points (i.e. points other than the endpoints). LinearRings - closed line
  strings which intersect only at their endpoints are simple
- MultiLineString geometries are simple if their elements are simple and
  they intersect only at points which are boundary points of both elements
- Polygonal geometries have no definition of simplicity.
  The `isSimple` code checks if all polygon rings are simple.
  This means that isSimple cannot be used to test for ALL self-intersections
  in Polygons. Use [`isValid`](isValid.mdx) to check polygonal geometries for
  self-intersections
- GeometryCollection geometries are simple if all their elements are simple
- Empty geometries are simple

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| `geometry` | [**`Geometry`**](../types/Geometry/index.mdx) | The geometry to check |

## Returns

**`boolean`** `true` when geometry is simple, `false` otherwise

## Throws

- [**`GEOSError`**](../types/errors.mdx#GEOSError) on unsupported geometry types (curved)

## See also

- [`isValid`](isValid.mdx) checks whether a geometry is well-formed

## Examples

```js live noInline
const a = lineString([ [ 0, 0 ], [ 2, 2 ], [ 1, 2 ], [ 1, 0 ] ]);
const a_simple = isSimple(a); // false - self-intersection

const b = multiLineString([ [ [ 2, 0 ], [ 4, 2 ] ], [ [ 3, 2 ], [ 4, 2 ] ] ]);
const b_simple = isSimple(b); // true - intersection at endpoints is ok

const c = lineString([ [ 4, 0 ], [ 5, 1 ], [ 5, 2 ], [ 6, 1 ], [ 5, 1 ] ]);
const c_simple = isSimple(c); // false - intersection not at the endpoints

const d = lineString([ [ 7, 1 ], [ 7, 2 ], [ 8, 1 ], [ 7, 1 ] ]);
const d_simple = isSimple(d); // true - ring

// this example is alive!
render(preview({ a, a_simple, b, b_simple, c, c_simple, d, d_simple }));
```
