# growMemory

For performance optimization.
Increases the size of the `WebAssembly.Memory` _by_ or _to_ a specified
number of bytes.

Internally, the number of bytes will be rounded up to the closest multiple
of 64KB - WebAssembly page size.

When you know you will need a larger chunk of memory, 500MB for example,
you can reserve it in advance. Otherwise, Wasm memory would increase
dynamically in multiple steps, which could affect performance
as with each step `WebAssembly.Memory` views must be recreated -
[detachment upon growing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface/Memory/grow#detachment_upon_growing).

The initial `WebAssembly.Memory` size is 16MB and grows dynamically
up to the 4GB limit.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| `options` | **`{ by: number }`** \| **`{ to: number }`** | Object with either `by` or `to` property |
| `options.by` | **`number`** | By how many bytes the memory will grow; incremental step |
| `options.to` | **`number`** | To how many bytes the memory will grow; target value |

## Returns

**`number`** The new size of the memory, in bytes

## Examples

```js title="grow memory by 512MB"
growMemory({ by: 512 * 1024 * 1024 });
```

```js title="grow memory to 1GB"
growMemory({ to: 1204 * 1024 * 1024 });
```

```js title="reserve all available memory (limited to 4GB for wasm32 target)"
growMemory({ to: Infinity });
```

```js title="get current memory size"
growMemory({ by: 0 });
```
