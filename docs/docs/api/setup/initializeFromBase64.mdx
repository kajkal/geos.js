# initializeFromBase64

The most convenient way to initialize `geos.js` module.
The .wasm file is embedded directly into the .js file as a base64 string.
Although convenient, this causes a certain penalty during initial initialization
due to base64 to binary conversion and ~33% overhead of .wasm file size.

Note that the returned module is just stateless, compiled WebAssembly code.
`WebAssembly.Module` could be shared with another worker or window via `postMessage`.

## Returns

[**`Promise`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<[**`WebAssembly.Module`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface/Module)\> A Promise that resolves with the `WebAssembly.Module`

## See also

- [`initialize`](initialize.mdx) initializes `geos.js` module from a fetch request
or already compiled module
- [`terminate`](terminate.mdx) terminates initialized `geos.js` instance

## Examples

```js title="in any environment"
await initializeFromBase64();
```
